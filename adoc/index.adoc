== Writing in AsciiDoc

This journey begins one late Monday afternoon in Antwerp.
Our team desperately needs coffee, but none of us dare open the office door.

To leave means code dismemberment and certain death.

Rubies are red, +
Topazes are blue.

[%hardbreaks]
Ruby is red.
Java is black.

== Mild punctuation, strong impact

bold *constrained* & **un**constrained

italic _constrained_ & __un__constrained

bold italic *_constrained_* & **__un__**constrained

monospace `constrained` & ``un``constrained

monospace bold `*constrained*` & ``**un**``constrained

monospace italic `_constrained_` & ``__un__``constrained

monospace bold italic `*_constrained_*` & ``**__un__**``constrained

Type the word [.userinput]#asciidoc# into the search bar.

== Preventing substitution

=== Backslash escaping

\*Stars* will appear as *Stars*, not as bold text.

\&sect; will appear as an entity, not the &sect; symbol.

\\__func__ will appear as __func__, not as emphasized text.

\{two-semicolons} will appear {two-semicolons}, not resolved as ;;.

=== inline pass macro

pass:[content like #{variable} passed directly to the output] followed by normal content.

content with only select substitutions applied: pass:c,a[__<{email}>__]

== Replacements

AsciiDoc also recognizes textual representations of symbols, arrows and dashes.
